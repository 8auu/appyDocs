## Get started

First of all you need to ensure that Appy is in your server and has the correct permissions. You can Invite Appy by clicking this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=853327905357561948\&permissions=8\&scope=applications.commands%20bot).

Appy only asks for permissions which it needs in order to function properly. You can read more about this [here](permissions.md).
